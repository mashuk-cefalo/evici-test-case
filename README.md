# Evici-test-case

## Approaches

- I tried two approaches
  - Show directly the blended tiff file. Tried it in `showBlendedFile` function.
  - read the buffers from both the tiff files. Tried it in `showSatelliteView` function.


## Important classes

- The main entry point og this `src/app/app.component.ts`  class

- There are some services in `src/service` folder to create custom terrain.

- And also some utility  functions in `src/utility/tiff-utils.ts` file
